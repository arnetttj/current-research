Current and ongoing research (beginning May 2017)

This document includes current and previous work on various research topics for my PhD work. The overall goal is to develop methods for cooperative control of multiple UAVs with a common goal (most likely the mario kart-esque manuever problem). Topics include both the comparison of sFIS and hFIS with respect to approximation abilities and strategies for splitting an sFIS into an hFIS based on predictions of the underlying unknown target function.

Also includes weekly updates with progress made and new/ongoing issues. Stream of consciousness notes are a (hopefully not too terrifying) look into my thought processes and the questions that arise from them. These are completely fair game for criticism and I encourage that so I don't waste time.
